## Huia Store Test

## Roadmap

# Step 1 - Basic CRUD operations

Create basic CRUD operations for each module below:
    customers
    products
    users
    sales

# Step 2 - Inventory and product sale control

Both products and sales modules will gain more complex layers, making possible to control batches and detailing which product was sold

# Step 3 - Security layer

Now all operations will need an user, password and access level :
    Admin - All modules
    Seller - Read-only customers and products modules, all access to sales module
    Customer - Read-only to his data in sales module


# Step 4 - Report sales

Add options to return customer and product details into sales GET endpoint


# More steps will come
